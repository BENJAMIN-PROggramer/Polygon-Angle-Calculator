# Description of the program
- The app takes an input value representing the number of sides of a polygon.
+ It calculates the interior angle of the polygon using the formula:Interior Angle = **(Number of Sides−2)×180**

- If the input value is less than 2 (which doesn’t form a valid polygon), it displays an error message.
+ The app also provides options to calculate additional angles:
- Interior Vertex Angle: If the user selects this option, it divides the interior angle by the number of sides and displays the result.
- Exterior Vertex Angle: It calculates the exterior angle for each vertex of the polygon (assuming a regular polygon with equal angles).The exterior angle for a regular polygon is given by : Exterior Angle = **360 / Number of Sides**
+ The app updates the UI with the calculated angles or error messages based on user selections.
